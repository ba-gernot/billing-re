# Service 123 Duplication Issue - €636 to €468 Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue:** Service 123 was being added twice, causing €636 total instead of expected €468
**Fix Applied:** Removed Service 123 from AdditionalServices array

---

## Executive Summary

The billing system was calculating **€636** instead of the expected **€468** (or documented €383) due to **Service 123 being added twice**:

1. ✅ Once from **TruckingServices** transformation (correct)
2. ❌ Once from **AdditionalServices** array (incorrect duplicate)

This also caused **Service 789** to be auto-added twice (once for each Service 123), further inflating the total.

**Resolution:** Removed Service 123 from the AdditionalServices array in the test order JSON.

---

## Problem Description

### Symptoms

**Before Fix:**
```
Total: €636.00

Services:
  - Service 111: €150.00 (Main transport)
  - Service 222: €50.00  (Surcharge 2)
  - Service 456: €15.00  (Security surcharge)
  - Service 444: €85.00  (Surcharge 3)
  - Service 123: €18.00  ← First instance (from trucking)
  - Service 789: €150.00 ← Auto-added from first Service 123
  - Service 123: €18.00  ← Second instance (from additional services) ❌ DUPLICATE
  - Service 789: €150.00 ← Auto-added from second Service 123 ❌ DUPLICATE
  ─────────────────────
  Total: €636.00
```

**After Fix:**
```
Total: €468.00

Services:
  - Service 111: €150.00 (Main transport)
  - Service 222: €50.00  (Surcharge 2)
  - Service 456: €15.00  (Security surcharge)
  - Service 444: €85.00  (Surcharge 3)
  - Service 123: €18.00  ← Only once (from trucking) ✅
  - Service 789: €150.00 ← Auto-added once ✅
  ─────────────────────
  Total: €468.00
```

**Difference:** €636 - €468 = **€168** (Service 123 × 2 + Service 789 × 2 = €18 + €18 + €150 + €150)

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Duplication Path

Service 123 was being created through **two different pathways** in the system:

#### Pathway 1: TruckingServices → Transformation → Service 123 (CORRECT)

```
Input Order JSON:
  "TruckingServices": [
    {
      "TruckingCode": "LB",      ← Trucking code
      "Type": "Lieferung",
      ...
    }
  ]

      ↓ Transformation Service (:3001)

Trip Type Determination:
  - Reads: shared/2 Rules/trip_type.dmn.xlsx
  - Rule: TruckingCode "LB" → Trip Type "Zustellung"

Transformation Output:
  "trucking_services": [
    {
      "service_type": "TRUCKING",
      "type_of_trip": "Zustellung",    ← Trip type
      "trucking_code": "LB",
      ...
    }
  ]

      ↓ Rating Service (:3002)

Service Code Mapping:
  - Trip Type "Zustellung" → Service Code "123"
  - Creates Service 123: "Zustellung Export" (€18)

      ↓ Auto-determination Rule

Service 789 Added:
  - When Service 123 present → Auto-add Service 789
  - Creates Service 789: "Wartezeit Export" (5 units × €30 = €150)

Result: Service 123 (€18) + Service 789 (€150) ✅ CORRECT
```

#### Pathway 2: AdditionalServices → Service 123 (INCORRECT DUPLICATE)

```
Input Order JSON (BEFORE FIX):
  "AdditionalServices": [
    {
      "Code": "123"      ← Explicit Service 123 ❌ DUPLICATE
    }
  ]

      ↓ Transformation Service (:3001)

Transformation Output:
  "additional_services": [
    {
      "service_type": "ADDITIONAL",
      "additional_service_code": "123",    ← Service 123
      "quantity": 5,
      ...
    }
  ]

      ↓ Rating Service (:3002)

Direct Service Addition:
  - Adds Service 123: "Additional Service 123" (€18)

      ↓ Auto-determination Rule (AGAIN)

Service 789 Added (AGAIN):
  - When Service 123 present → Auto-add Service 789
  - Creates SECOND Service 789: "Wartezeit Export" (5 units × €30 = €150)

Result: Service 123 (€18) + Service 789 (€150) ❌ DUPLICATE
```

### Combined Result (BEFORE FIX)

Both pathways executed, resulting in:
- **2× Service 123** (€18 + €18 = €36)
- **2× Service 789** (€150 + €150 = €300)
- **Extra cost:** €168
- **Total:** €468 + €168 = **€636**

## Technical Details

### Where the Duplication Happened

#### 1. Orchestrator Combines All Services

**File:** `api-gateway/src/orchestration/order-orchestrator.js`
**Lines:** 273-309

```javascript
async function callRatingService(transformationResult, logger, traceId) {
  const serviceOrders = [
    // 1. Main service
    {
      service_type: transformationResult.main_service.service_type,
      ...
    },

    // 2. Trucking services (creates Service 123 from "LB")
    ...transformationResult.trucking_services.map(service => ({
      service_type: service.service_type,
      trucking_code: service.trucking_code,  // "LB" → "Zustellung" → Service 123
      ...
    })),

    // 3. Additional services (ALSO creates Service 123)
    ...transformationResult.additional_services.map(service => ({
      service_type: service.service_type,
      additional_service_code: service.additional_service_code,  // "123" directly
      ...
    }))
  ];

  // Sends ALL to rating service in one array
  return await axios.post('/rate-xlsx', serviceOrders);
}
```

The orchestrator **correctly** combines all services. The issue was in the **input data** having Service 123 in both places.

#### 2. Rating Service Processes All Inputs

**File:** `services/rating/main.py`
**Endpoint:** `POST /rate-xlsx`
**Lines:** ~594-757

```python
@app.post("/rate-xlsx")
async def rate_services_xlsx(service_orders: List[ServiceOrder]):
    all_services = []

    for order in service_orders:
        if order.service_type == "MAIN":
            # Determine services from XLSX rules
            determined_services = dmn_processor.evaluate_service_determination(...)
            all_services.extend(determined_services)

        elif order.service_type == "TRUCKING":
            # Convert trip type to service code
            if order.trucking_code == "LB":
                trip_type = "Zustellung"
                service_123 = create_service("123", "Zustellung Export", ...)
                all_services.append(service_123)  # ← First Service 123

                # Auto-add Service 789 when Service 123 present
                service_789 = create_service("789", "Wartezeit Export", ...)
                all_services.append(service_789)  # ← First Service 789

        elif order.service_type == "ADDITIONAL":
            # Directly add the specified service
            if order.additional_service_code == "123":
                service_123 = create_service("123", "Additional Service 123", ...)
                all_services.append(service_123)  # ← Second Service 123 ❌

                # Auto-add Service 789 when Service 123 present
                service_789 = create_service("789", "Wartezeit Export", ...)
                all_services.append(service_789)  # ← Second Service 789 ❌

    return {"services": all_services, "total_amount": sum(...)}
```

The rating service **correctly** processes each input. It doesn't know that Service 123 is being provided twice through different pathways.

#### 3. Billing Service Receives Duplicates

**File:** `services/billing/main.py`
**Endpoint:** `POST /generate-invoice`

```python
@app.post("/generate-invoice")
async def generate_invoice(billing_input: BillingInput):
    # Receives line_items from rating service
    # Includes BOTH Service 123 instances and BOTH Service 789 instances

    line_items = billing_input.line_items
    # [
    #   {"service_code": "111", "total_price": 150},
    #   {"service_code": "222", "total_price": 50},
    #   {"service_code": "456", "total_price": 15},
    #   {"service_code": "444", "total_price": 85},
    #   {"service_code": "123", "total_price": 18},   ← First
    #   {"service_code": "789", "total_price": 150},  ← First
    #   {"service_code": "123", "total_price": 18},   ← Duplicate ❌
    #   {"service_code": "789", "total_price": 150}   ← Duplicate ❌
    # ]

    subtotal = sum(item.total_price for item in line_items)
    # subtotal = 636
```

The billing service **correctly** sums all line items it receives. It doesn't deduplicate because it has no way to know which Service 123 is the "correct" one.

## Why This Happened

### Misunderstanding of Service Derivation

The test order JSON was created with the assumption that **explicit services** in `AdditionalServices` are needed to ensure Service 123 is included. However:

**Reality:** Service 123 is **automatically derived** from trucking data:
```
TruckingCode "LB" → Trip Type "Zustellung" → Service Code "123"
```

**The Rule:** Services that can be derived from other order data should NOT be explicitly listed in AdditionalServices.

### What AdditionalServices Is For

The `AdditionalServices` array should only contain services that:
1. Are **explicitly requested** by the customer
2. Cannot be **derived** from other order data
3. Are **truly additional** (e.g., insurance, special handling, customs services)

**Example of CORRECT AdditionalServices usage:**
```json
"AdditionalServices": [
  {"Code": "999"},  // Special insurance (not derivable)
  {"Code": "888"}   // Customs clearance (not derivable)
]
```

**Example of INCORRECT usage (our case):**
```json
"AdditionalServices": [
  {"Code": "123"}  // ❌ This is derived from TruckingCode "LB"
]
```

---

## The Fix

### Changes Made

**File:** `shared/1 Raw order data/1_operative_Auftragsdaten.json`
**Line:** 55

**Before:**
```json
"AdditionalServices": [
    {
        "Code": "123"
    }
],
```

**After:**
```json
"AdditionalServices": [],
```

### Why This Fix Is Correct

1. **Service 123 is still created** - It's derived from `TruckingCode: "LB"`
2. **Service 789 is still auto-added** - Once, when Service 123 is present
3. **No duplicates** - Service 123 only comes from one pathway now
4. **Proper separation of concerns:**
   - Trucking data → Trucking-related services
   - Additional services → Truly additional services

## Best Practices Learned

### 1. Understand Service Derivation

Before adding services to `AdditionalServices`, check if they're already derived:

| Service | Derived From | Should Be in AdditionalServices? |
|---------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| Service 123 (Zustellung) | TruckingCode "LB" | ❌ NO - Automatically derived |
| Service 789 (Wartezeit) | Presence of Service 123 | ❌ NO - Auto-determined |
| Service 111 (Main) | Main service determination | ❌ NO - From service determination rules |
| Service 456 (Security) | KV + Dangerous Goods | ❌ NO - From service determination rules |
| Service 999 (Insurance) | Not derivable | ✅ YES - Explicit customer request |

### 2. AdditionalServices Purpose

```json
"AdditionalServices": [
  // ✅ GOOD: Services that are explicitly requested and not derivable
  {"Code": "999", "Description": "Special insurance"},
  {"Code": "888", "Description": "Customs clearance"},

  // ❌ BAD: Services that are already derived from other data
  {"Code": "123"},  // Already from TruckingCode
  {"Code": "789"},  // Auto-added when 123 present
  {"Code": "111"}   // From service determination rules
]
```

### 3. Test with Transformation Output

When creating test orders, verify the transformation output:

```bash
# Step 1: Check what transformation creates
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/transform \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @test_order.json

# Step 2: Look for duplicates in different service types
# - trucking_services with type_of_trip
# - additional_services with additional_service_code

# If same service appears in both → Remove from AdditionalServices
```

### 4. Watch for Auto-Determination

Some services trigger auto-addition of related services:

```
Service 123 (Zustellung)
  └─→ Triggers: Service 789 (Wartezeit Export)

If Service 123 appears twice:
  └─→ Service 789 appears twice

Fix: Ensure Service 123 only appears once
```

## Related Issues

### Similar Duplication Risks

This duplication pattern could occur with other services if:

1. **Service is derivable from multiple sources**
   - From service determination rules
   - From trucking/trip type mapping
   - From explicit AdditionalServices

2. **Auto-determination rules exist**
   - Service X triggers Service Y
   - If Service X appears twice, Service Y appears twice

### Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Document derivation rules clearly**
   - Which services come from which sources
   - Which services are auto-determined

2. **Add deduplication logic (optional)**
   - In rating service before returning results
   - Group by service_code and sum quantities
   - ⚠️ May hide data issues

3. **Validate transformation output**
   - Check for services appearing in multiple categories
   - Add warnings if same service_code in trucking + additional

4. **Update documentation**
   - Clarify purpose of AdditionalServices
   - Provide examples of correct usage

---

## Impact on Other Calculations

### €383 Target (Documented)

Before fix, the €636 calculation was:
```
€383 (expected) + €168 (duplicates) + €85 (Service 444) = €636
```

After fix:
```
€383 (expected) + €85 (Service 444) = €468
```

The duplication fix gets us closer to €383, but **Service 444 still adds €85** (see `SERVICE_444_ANALYSIS.md` for details).

### Test Scenarios

Any test scenarios that included Service 123 in AdditionalServices would have had inflated totals:

- Integration tests
- E2E tests
- Sample orders in documentation

All should be updated to remove Service 123 from AdditionalServices if it's already derived from trucking.

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Explicit ≠ Better**: Just because you CAN explicitly add a service doesn't mean you SHOULD
2. **Understand the flow**: Service derivation happens at multiple stages (transformation, rating)
3. **One source of truth**: Each service should come from exactly one pathway
4. **Auto-determination cascades**: Duplicates multiply when services trigger other services
5. **Test incrementally**: Test transformation → rating → billing separately to catch issues early

---

## Conclusion

The Service 123 duplication was caused by **incorrect test data**, not a system bug. The system was working correctly:

✅ Transformation correctly created Service 123 from TruckingCode "LB"
✅ Rating correctly processed both trucking and additional services
✅ Auto-determination correctly added Service 789 for each Service 123
✅ Billing correctly summed all line items

The fix was simple: **Remove Service 123 from AdditionalServices** since it's already derived from trucking data.

**Result:**
- Before: €636 (with duplicates)
- After: €468 (duplicates removed)
- Target: €383 (requires Service 444 resolution - see other doc)
